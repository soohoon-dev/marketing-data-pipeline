# Operating System (How I Work)

This page documents my execution routines for paid media + measurement.

---

## 1) Planning → Setup
- Define the question (Ask) and success criteria
- Campaign architecture & naming conventions
- Measurement plan: GA4 events, parameters, UTMs
- Tracking QA plan (before launch)

---

## 2) Launch QA (Day 0–2)
**Campaign QA**
- Budget, schedule, geo, language, audience validation
- Placement strategy applied (incl. community placements where relevant)
- Exclusions applied:
  - negative keywords / irrelevant intent
  - competitor terms rule-set
  - domain/site exclusions (brand safety)

**Measurement QA**
- GTM preview tests
- GA4 event firing validation
- UTM consistency check
- Landing page conversion path sanity check

---

## 3) Optimization Loop
- Daily: anomaly checks (spend spikes, tracking drops)
- Weekly: test readouts + decision log updates
- Monthly: structure review (audience mix, exclusions refresh, creative rotation)

---

## 4) Reporting & Stakeholder Q&A
- Convert data into decisions:
  - what changed?
  - why did it change?
  - what will we do next?
- I keep a decision log to preserve context and avoid “opinion-only” debates.
