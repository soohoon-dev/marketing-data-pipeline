# Confidentiality & Redaction

Some work cannot be shared publicly due to client confidentiality and privacy constraints.

## What I can share
- Playbooks, checklists, frameworks
- Anonymized case studies (Ask → Act)
- Proposals (planning documents)
- Aggregated metrics (only if non-identifying)

## What I do not share
- Client identity, platform screenshots, account IDs
- Row-level exports that reveal sensitive performance
- Any PII (names, phone numbers, emails, free-text messages)

## Skincare form data (example)
OK:
- total inquiries (e.g., ~40 in ~3 months)
- bucketed distributions (percentages/ranges)
- GA4 high-level aggregates (channels/pages)

Not OK:
- row-level CSV with contact info
- anything that can identify individuals
