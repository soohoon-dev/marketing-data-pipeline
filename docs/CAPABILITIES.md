# Capabilities

A concise overview of what I execute as a performance marketing operator and measurement lead.

---

## Positioning
**Technical Performance Marketing Lead | Paid Media + Measurement (GA4/GTM)**  
I build measurable growth systems: planning → setup → QA → optimization → reporting → stakeholder Q&A.

---

## Platforms / Channels
### Google Ads
- Search
- Display
- Video (YouTube)

### DV360
- Display
- Digital Audio
- CTV (Digital TV)

---

## Markets / Targeting
- US multicultural markets including **Korean** and **Chinese** segments
- Language targeting + geo clusters (e.g., **Koreatown** use cases)
- Interests, 3rd-party audiences, community placements
- Exclusions: negative keywords, competitor terms, excluded domains/sites (brand safety)

---

## Measurement
- GA4 event taxonomy & measurement planning
- GTM implementation notes + QA routines
- Reporting design: what to track, how to read, how to decide

---

## Evidence approach (public portfolio)
When screenshots or raw metrics can’t be shared, I provide:
- playbooks & checklists
- anonymized case studies (Ask → Act)
- proposals (planning documents)
- redacted samples (if safe)
