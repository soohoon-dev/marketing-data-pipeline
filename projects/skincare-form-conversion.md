## Summary
Renewed the website and redesigned the consulting form to increase quality inquiries without paid media.

---

## What I did
- Site structure and conversion path improvements
- Multi-step consulting form design:
  - New vs existing
  - Category routing
  - Age bucket (if used)
  - Clear guidance per step

---

## Measurement & limitations
### Available
- Total form submissions (aggregate)
- GA4 top pages / channel mix (aggregate)

### Limitations
- No reliable per-submitter path reconstruction
- Attribution is directional, not user-level

---

## Results (safe-to-share)
- Total inquiries: ~40 (3 months)
- *(Optional)* distributions as percentages/ranges only

## Next improvements
- Thank-you page event + richer submit metadata (non-PII)
- CRM integration (if applicable)
